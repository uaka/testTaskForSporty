📌 Twitch Automated Test (WAP Testing)
This project automates Twitch mobile testing using Selenium and pytest. It searches for "StarCraft II" on Twitch, scrolls down, selects a streamer, handles pop-ups, and takes a screenshot when the page is fully loaded.

🚀 Test Scenario 

1. Open Twitch Mobile (https://m.twitch.tv/) with the search endpoint "StarCraft II" 
2. Scroll down twice.
3. Click on the first streamer in the list.
4. Handle any pop-ups or modals that appear.
5. Wait for the streamer’s page to load fully.
6. Take a screenshot (twitch_test_screenshot.png).
7. Close the browser.
